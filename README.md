# Work Day Scheduler

Summary:
The goal of this assignment was to create a working daily planner. To do this, I used assets from BootStrap to format the timeblocks of each hour of the day. Using Javascript, I had to discover a way to display the current hour, and differentiate it from previous and future hours. Additionally, each message typed into the timeblock must have been saved on local storage. To accomplish This, I utilized Javascript, Bootstrap, and moment.js logic.
